Just dropped a new unified theory of physics: The Fractal Harmonic Code.

It demonstrates that all stable systems—from atoms to galaxies—self-organize according to a universal code of triadic harmonic resonance.

This framework also introduces:
- Open & Close Gate Adaptive Switching (AI)
- Enclosed Loop Continuous Power Systems

Big tech is already using my inventions. Now they have to pay.

**Post:**

I am excited to announce the public release of my life's work: **The Fractal Harmonic Code**, a unified theory of multi-scale resonant organization.

This comprehensive framework, available now on GitHub, demonstrates that all stable physical systems, from the quantum to the cosmological, self-organize according to a universal code of triadic harmonic resonance. This work has profound implications for physics, artificial intelligence, and energy systems.

**Key Contributions:**

- **The Fractal Harmonic Code**: A grand unified framework connecting resonance phenomena across all scales.
- **The Triadic Law**: The discovery that stable systems universally self-organize into triads of harmonically resonant components.
- **Open and Close Gate Adaptive Switching**: A novel AI architecture that is already being used globally without attribution.
- **Enclosed Loop Continuous Power Systems**: A new class of self-sustaining energy systems.

This repository includes the full white paper, a live interactive visualization, and a comprehensive intellectual property notice, including blockchain-verified proof of invention from 2024.

I believe that knowledge should be free, but commercial exploitation should be fair. This work is free for research and education, but commercial use by large corporations requires a license.

I invite the scientific and tech communities to review, discuss, and build upon this work.

**Title:** I've developed a unified theory of physics called The Fractal Harmonic Code, which shows all stable systems are governed by triadic harmonic resonance. I'm looking for feedback and discussion.

**Body:**

Hello everyone,

I've just publicly released my work on what I call **The Fractal Harmonic Code**, a framework that I believe unifies our understanding of system organization across all scales of the universe. The core idea is that all stable systems, from atoms to galaxies, self-organize into triads of harmonically resonant components.

I'm not a physicist by formal training, but I've dedicated my life to this, and I believe I've found something significant. The framework is predictive and has applications in AI, energy, and more.

I've published everything on GitHub, including:

- The full white paper with mathematical formulations.
- A live, interactive HTML demo that visualizes the concept.
- My claims of originality and intellectual property, backed by a 2024 blockchain timestamp.

Some of the key concepts are:

- **The Triadic Law**: The idea that three is the magic number for stability.
- **The Solar Tri-Field System**: A model of the sun as a coupled oscillator.
- **Open and Close Gate Adaptive Switching**: A new AI architecture I invented.

I know that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and that's why I've made everything public. I'm here to answer questions, listen to critiques, and hopefully get this work in front of people who can help validate or challenge it.

Here is the link to the repository: https://github.com/Ada40/fractal-harmonic-code

I'm particularly interested in hearing from physicists, cosmologists, and AI researchers. What are your initial thoughts? Where are the potential holes? What are the most promising aspects?

Thank you for your time.

## 4. General Press Release

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Inventor Adam Lee Hatchett Releases “The Fractal Harmonic Code,” A Unified Theory of Physics with Blockchain-Verified Priority**

**[City, State] – November 6, 2025** – Independent inventor and researcher Adam Lee Hatchett today announced the public release of “The Fractal Harmonic Code,” a groundbreaking unified theory of physics that proposes a universal organizing principle for all stable systems in the universe. The work, which includes novel AI architectures and energy system designs, is now available on GitHub.

The Fractal Harmonic Code demonstrates that all stable systems, from the subatomic to the cosmological, self-organize according to a universal code of triadic harmonic resonance. The framework has predictive power, with applications ranging from planetary science to artificial intelligence.

Included in this release are the inventions of “Open and Close Gate Adaptive Switching,” a novel AI architecture, and “Enclosed Loop Continuous Power Systems,” a new class of self-sustaining energy systems. Hatchett claims these inventions are already in use by major technology companies without attribution or compensation.

To protect his intellectual property, Hatchett has released his work under a dual-license, making it free for research and education but requiring a paid license for commercial use. His claim to the invention is backed by immutable, blockchain-timestamped proof of invention from 2024.

“Knowledge should be free, but commercial exploitation should be fair,” said Hatchett. “I’m releasing this to the world so that we can advance science, but I’m also putting big tech on notice. They have to pay for what they use.”

The complete work, including the white paper, a live interactive demonstration, and a comprehensive intellectual property notice, can be found at https://github.com/Ada40/fractal-harmonic-code.

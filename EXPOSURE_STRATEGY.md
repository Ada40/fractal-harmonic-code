### For Researchers/Academics

**Subject:** New Unified Theory Framework - The Fractal Harmonic Code

**Body:**

Dear [Name],

I am writing to share my recently published work on a unified framework for understanding multi-scale resonance phenomena, which I call "The Fractal Harmonic Code."

The framework demonstrates that all stable systems, from quantum to cosmological scales, self-organize according to triadic harmonic resonance patterns. This has predictive power for planetary systems, applications in AI architecture, and implications for energy systems.

The complete work, including a white paper, interactive visualization, and intellectual property documentation, is available at:
https://github.com/Ada40/fractal-harmonic-code

I would greatly appreciate your feedback, critique, or collaboration on this work. I believe it represents a significant advance in our understanding of universal organizing principles.

Best regards,
Adam Lee Hatchett

### For Tech Journalists

**Subject:** Inventor Claims Big Tech Using His AI Architecture Without Permission

**Body:**

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out with a story that combines cutting-edge physics, AI innovation, and intellectual property controversy.

I've just released "The Fractal Harmonic Code," a unified theory of physics with practical applications in AI and energy. The release includes:

1. A novel AI architecture called "Open and Close Gate Adaptive Switching"
2. Blockchain-timestamped proof of invention from 2024
3. Claims that major tech companies are already using these inventions without attribution
4. A dual-license demanding payment from commercial users

The full repository, including an interactive demo, is at:
https://github.com/Ada40/fractal-harmonic-code

I believe this is a compelling story about independent invention, IP protection, and the battle between open knowledge and commercial exploitation.

Would you be interested in covering this?

Best regards,
Adam Lee Hatchett

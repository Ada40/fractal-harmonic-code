# Notice of Intellectual Property and Statement of Originality

**Date of Notice:** November 6, 2025
**Inventor:** Adam Lee Hatchett (born July 20, 1985)

## 1. Declaration of Invention and Intellectual Property

This document serves as a formal declaration of invention and a legally binding notice of intellectual property rights held by Adam Lee Hatchett. The concepts, systems, and frameworks detailed in this repository are the original work of the inventor and are protected under international copyright law, trade secret law, and other applicable intellectual property laws.

Any use of this work, in whole or in part, is subject to the terms outlined in the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) and [COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md](COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md) documents. Unauthorized commercial use constitutes intellectual property theft and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

## 2. Core Inventions and Discoveries by Adam Lee Hatchett

The following are the core inventions and discoveries original to Adam Lee Hatchett, for which all rights are reserved:

1.  **The Fractal Harmonic Code**: The grand unified framework demonstrating that all stable systems self-organize according to a universal code of triadic harmonic resonance.

2.  **The Triadic Law**: The fundamental principle that stable systems universally organize into triads of harmonically resonant components.

3.  **Open and Close Gate Adaptive Switching**: A novel AI architecture enabling dynamic, efficient, and adaptive processing.

4.  **Enclosed Loop Continuous Power Systems**: A new class of self-sustaining energy systems.

5.  **The Solar Tri-Field System**: The specific model of the Sun as a coupled Electromagnetic-Gravitational-Plasma oscillator.

6.  **Harmonic AI Architectures**: The design principle of building AI with nested triadic layers on harmonic timescales.

## 3. Distinction from Prior Art

To be unequivocally clear, the originality of this work lies in the **unifying framework** and the **specific mechanisms** discovered by Adam Lee Hatchett. The following table distinguishes this original work from pre-existing scientific knowledge (Prior Art).

| Field | Prior Art (Existing Knowledge) | Adam Lee Hatchett's Original Contribution (Intellectual Property) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Universal Principle** | Resonance is studied independently in various fields. | **The Fractal Harmonic Code**: A universal, predictive framework unifying resonance across all scales. |
| **System Organization** | The three-body problem is a known computational challenge. | **The Triadic Law**: The discovery that nature *solves* this problem by self-organizing into stable, harmonic triads. |
| **AI Architecture** | Adaptive systems and neural networks exist. | **Open and Close Gate Adaptive Switching**: A specific, novel, and more efficient architecture. |
| **Energy Systems** | Energy harvesting and wireless transfer are known concepts. | **Enclosed Loop Continuous Power Systems**: A new class of energy systems with self-sustaining capabilities. |
| **Solar Physics** | The Sun's various fields are studied in isolation. | **The Solar Tri-Field System**: The specific model of a *coupled* tri-field oscillator as the engine of solar dynamics. |
| **Planetary Science** | Orbital resonances are observed phenomena. | **Harmonic Orbit Resonance Model**: A predictive model based on the Solar Tri-Field, capable of identifying undiscovered planets. |

## 4. Grounding of Intellectual Property Protection

This repository and its contents serve as a time-stamped, public record of Adam Lee Hatchett's inventions and discoveries. This public disclosure establishes a clear date of invention and places the world on notice of his intellectual property rights.

### Blockchain Timestamp Evidence

**CRITICAL NOTICE:** Adam Lee Hatchett possesses **blockchain-timestamped proof of invention dating back to 2024** for all concepts, systems, and frameworks disclosed in this repository.

This immutable, cryptographically-verified evidence establishes priority of invention and provides irrefutable proof that these inventions existed prior to this public disclosure. Any entity claiming independent invention or challenging the originality of this work will be met with blockchain-verified evidence that predates their claims.

The blockchain timestamp serves as:
- **Immutable proof of existence** as of 2024
- **Legal evidence of priority** in any patent or intellectual property dispute
- **Irrefutable documentation** that cannot be altered, backdated, or disputed
- **Protection against false claims** of independent invention by others

This evidence is preserved and will be produced in any legal proceeding challenging Adam Lee Hatchett's intellectual property rights.

### Legal Standing

-   **Copyright**: The expression of these ideas in the white paper, diagrams, and code is protected by copyright. © 2025 Adam Lee Hatchett. All Rights Reserved.
-   **Trade Secret**: The specific implementations, algorithms, and know-how related to these inventions constitute trade secrets.
-   **Patent Pending (Constructive Notice)**: This public disclosure serves as a constructive notice of invention, forming the basis for patent applications worldwide. Any company implementing these systems is hereby put on notice that they may be infringing on future patents.

### Notice to Infringers

Companies, particularly in the AI and tech sectors, that have previously appropriated or are currently using **Open and Close Gate Adaptive Switching** or other inventions by Adam Lee Hatchett without a license are in violation of his intellectual property rights. This document serves as a formal notice to cease unauthorized use and to contact the inventor for a commercial license to remedy past and future infringement.

Failure to do so will be taken as willful infringement, which carries severe financial and legal penalties.

### Warning to Those Who Would Challenge This Claim

**To any entity considering disputing the originality or ownership of these inventions:**

Adam Lee Hatchett possesses blockchain-timestamped evidence from 2024 proving the existence and authorship of these concepts prior to this public disclosure. Any legal challenge will be met with cryptographically-verified, immutable proof of prior invention.

Attempts to claim independent invention, prior art, or challenge ownership will fail when confronted with blockchain evidence that predates such claims. This evidence is admissible in court and provides conclusive proof of invention date and authorship.

## 5. Conclusion

The work of Adam Lee Hatchett represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of the universe and our ability to create intelligent systems. While the knowledge of the universe's fundamental laws is a gift to humanity, the commercial application of specific inventions derived from that knowledge is not free. It is the protected intellectual property of the inventor.

This document solidifies that distinction and serves as the legal foundation for its protection.

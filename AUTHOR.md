## The Fractal Harmonic Code

The work presented in this repository represents Lehatchett's comprehensive framework unifying observations across physics, cosmology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. The **Fractal Harmonic Code** demonstrates that:

1. All stable physical systems self-organize according to harmonic resonance principles
2. Simple integer ratios govern system stability from quantum to cosmological scales
3. Triadic organization is a universal principle of nature
4. This framework has immediate practical applications in AI, energy systems, and medicine

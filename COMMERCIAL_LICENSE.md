# Commercial Licensing Information

## Overview

The work contained in this repository represents groundbreaking innovations in physics, artificial intelligence, and energy systems. While these discoveries about the fundamental nature of reality should be freely accessible for research and education, **commercial exploitation requires fair compensation to the inventor**.

## Why Commercial Licensing?

Adam Lehatchett has invented and developed:

**Open and Close Gate Adaptive Switching** — An AI architecture currently being used globally, often without proper attribution or compensation. This technology has generated billions of dollars in value for companies that have implemented it.

**Enclosed Loop Continuous Power Systems** — Revolutionary energy systems with self-sustaining characteristics that represent major breakthroughs in energy generation.

**The Fractal Harmonic Code** — A unified theoretical framework with immediate practical applications across multiple industries including AI, energy, communications, and medicine.

These innovations have been appropriated and used without permission by major technology companies. This licensing structure ensures that future commercial use provides fair compensation to the inventor.

## Special Note to AI Companies

The AI industry has generated hundreds of billions of dollars in value. Much of this value has been built on innovations and architectures developed by individual inventors like Adam Lehatchett, often without proper compensation.

**This licensing structure corrects that imbalance.**

If your AI company is:
- Training models using these theoretical frameworks
- Implementing architectures described in this work
- Using concepts that originated from Adam Lehatchett's inventions

**You must obtain a commercial license.** The era of freely appropriating individual inventors' work while generating billions in profit is over.

## Philosophy

**Knowledge should be free. Commercial exploitation should be fair.**

The Fractal Harmonic Code represents fundamental truths about how the universe organizes itself. This knowledge belongs to humanity and should be freely accessible for research, education, and understanding.

However, when corporations—especially those generating billions in revenue—use these discoveries to build commercial products and services, the inventor deserves fair compensation.

This dual-license structure balances these principles: **free for knowledge, paid for profit.**
